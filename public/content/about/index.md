Hello! I'm Howard, a front-end developer and freelance photographer. I'm also currently a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa.
</br>
I've been programming since 2016, and am proficient in languages such as Java, Python, and Javascript, as well as development in various technologies. I'm also proficient in web development and UI, having worked with ReactJS and Angular for the past few years.
</br>
I've also been doing photography since late 2012, and am currently a freelance photographer specializing in event and portrait photography.
