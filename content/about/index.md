Hello! I'm Howard, a front-end developer and freelance photographer based in Toronto, Ontario. I'm also currently a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa.

I've been programming for around 5 years, and I'm proficient in a plethora of languages such as Java, Python, and C#. I've been using Flutter since its beta in early 2018, and have been developing mobile applications primarily with Flutter. I'm also currently working on my web development and UX design skills, and created this website from scratch using Gatsby.
I've also been working on my front-end and web development skills, and I am relatively proficient with Javascript, ReactJS, and Angular.

I've also been doing photography since late 2012. Ever since then, I've been quite passionate about photography, and am currently a freelance photographer specializing in event and portrait photography.
